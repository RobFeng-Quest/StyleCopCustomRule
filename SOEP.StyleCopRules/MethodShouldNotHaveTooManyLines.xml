        <Description>
          A method that grows too large tends to aggregate too many responsibilities. Such methods inevitably become harder to understand and therefore harder to maintain.
          Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor into smaller methods which focus on well-defined tasks. Those smaller methods will not only be easier to understand, but also probably easier to test.
